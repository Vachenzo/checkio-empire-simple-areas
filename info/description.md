You should write a function to calculate the area of simple figures: circles, rectangles and triangles.
You are given an arbitrary number of arguments which the function should use to calculate the area for the different figures.

- One argument -- The diameter and area of a circle.
- Two arguments -- The side lengths and area of a rectangle.
- Three arguments -- The lengths of each side and the area of a triangle.

The result should be given with a two digit precision of +/- 0.01
